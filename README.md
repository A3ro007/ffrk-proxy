# ffrk-proxyâ€‹

### Installation
**On Windows**:
If you don't have Nodejs installed, run `install.bat`, it will download a working version for you.
To start the proxy, just run `start.bat` and when your firewall is asking, please allow the access. Nodejs has to open a port, where the server is running.

**On Linux and Mac**:
Install Nodejs first via package manager.
Just type npm start to run it, all modules are already included, so please do not update them!

### Device configuration
I think you all know how to configure a proxy server on your phone/tablet.
For Android:
> Proxy: Manual

> Server Ip: IP of the computer where this proxy is running on

> Server Port: 5050

> Exclude for: 127.0.0.1

To install the root certificate, open `ComputerIP:5051` in your phones webbrowser and accept the certificate installation. Your system could request you to set a security pattern (pin, password, etc), you have to do this.
You have to install the certificate, it won't work without it.

### Proxy configuration
By default the proxy is looking for the file `default.yml` inside the `config` folder. There are some example files, which can be renamed to `default.yml`, to use them.
All available values can be found in `lib/config.js`.
For some of the basic settings, it is possible to pass them as command line arguments, e.g. `node bin/app.js --port 6050`.
To load a different config file, use `node bin/app.js --config myconfig`, where `myconfig` is the file `config/myconfig.yml`.
